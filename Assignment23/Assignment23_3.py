Question: 3: Write a Python program to implement a class named Numbers with the following 
specifications:
• The class should contain one instance variable:
◦ Value
• Define a constructor (__init__) that accepts a number from the user and initializes Value.
• Implement the following instance methods:
◦ ChkPrime() – returns True if the number is prime, otherwise returns False
◦ ChkPerfect() – returns True if the number is perfect, otherwise returns False
◦ Factors() – displays all factors of the number
◦ SumFactors() – returns the sum of all factors 
(You may use this method as a helper in ChkPerfect() if required)
• Create multiple objects and call all methods.
