Question: 2:  Write a Python program to implement a class named BankAccount with the following 
requirements:
• The class should contain two instance variables:
◦ Name (Account holder name)
◦ Amount (Account balance)
• The class should contain one class variable:
◦ ROI (Rate of Interest), initialized to 10.5
• Define a constructor (__init__) that accepts Name and initial Amount.
• Implement the following instance methods:
◦ Display() – displays account holder name and current balance
◦ Deposit() – accepts an amount from the user and adds it to balance
◦ Withdraw() – accepts an amount from the user and subtracts it from balance 
(Ensure withdrawal is allowed only if sufficient balance exists)
◦ CalculateInterest() – calculates and returns interest using formula: 
Interest = (Amount * ROI) / 100
• Create multiple objects and demonstrate all methods.
