Question:3: Write a Python program to implement a class named Arithmetic with the following 
characteristics:
• The class should contain two instance variables: Value1 and Value2.
• Define a constructor (__init__) that initializes all instance variables to 0.
• Implement the following instance methods:
◦ Accept() – accepts values for Value1 and Value2 from the user.
◦ Addition() – returns the addition of Value1 and Value2.
◦ Subtraction() – returns the subtraction of Value1 and Value2.
◦ Multiplication() – returns the multiplication of Value1 and Value2.
◦ Division() – returns the division of Value1 and Value2 (handle division by zero 
properly).
• Create multiple objects of the Arithmetic class and invoke all the instance methods.
