Question: 2:  Write a Python program to implement a class named Circle with the following 
requirements:
• The class should contain three instance variables: Radius, Area, and Circumference.
• The class should contain one class variable named PI, initialized to 3.14.
• Define a constructor (__init__) that initializes all instance variables to 0.0.
• Implement the following instance methods:
◦ Accept() – accepts the radius of the circle from the user.
◦ CalculateArea() – calculates the area of the circle and stores it in the Area variable.
◦ CalculateCircumference() – calculates the circumference of the circle and stores it in 
the Circumference variable.
 Display() – displays the values of Radius, Area, and Circumference.
• Create multiple objects of the Circle class and invoke all the instance methods for each object.
